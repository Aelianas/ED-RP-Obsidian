Bio:
Born into one of the best mining systems in the galaxy, Brahx cut his teeth on platinum. The credits rolled in and his ship roster blossomed. 

Growing up under the influence of the free thinking Yuri Grom, he also became a proficient bounty hunter and conflict zone agent.

For a brief stint, he ran courier missions for the Empire and achieved the rank of Duke. The Imperial Cutter was added to his inventory and swiftly became a fearsome mining machine. Elegance repurposed for industry. 

In the early part of 3311, he moved to Omicron Capricorni B and raked in a tremendous amount of credits from laser mining in that Cutter.

Before too long, his fortune facilitated the procurement of a fleet carrier. The [[Cuttlebone]], glowing ice white under starlight, has been his base of operations ever since. 

Later that year, he travelled to TZ Arietis, and switched allegiance to the Federation. It was an action of convenience. Then a springboard into a dedicated community of Pilot Federation CMDRs with a wealth of knowledge and experience. 

Reaching the rank of Admiral shortly after, his flagship is now the 'Anvil of Dusk'. A fully engineered, midnight black clad Federal Corvette, bristling with multicannons and bloodlust.

However, colonisation beckoned. He claimed a few interesting systems ~ 300ly from The Bubble. It was an interesting dabble of an adventure.  Hardwork. It takes teamwork to make the dream work.

And that is why Brahx is here, allied with the good people at HGCC. Shared dreams are easier to achieve. 

Feel free to stop by 'Brahx's Big Blue Base' in B352 Sector MY-Q b5-0. The door is unlocked and the kettle is on.
