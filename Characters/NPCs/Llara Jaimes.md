Status: Deceased
Age of Death: 61
Family: [[Aelianas Vagrantia]] (Adopted Daughter)

Llara Jaimes (Yah-ra High-Mehz) was the adoptive mother of [[Aelianas Vagrantia]] and former Senior Executive of [[Lucinda Corporation]]. Llara was very much against her associates' use of illegal money-making operations, such as the rescue mission that included an illegal salvage operation on a ship that led to the discovery of infant Aelianas.

Although Llara was more rule-abiding in most areas, she also knew that the law wasn't immune to corruption. She liked to have fun with criminals that were being looked over/ignored by law enforcement. She could get very crafty with her schemes of making the criminals suffer.
