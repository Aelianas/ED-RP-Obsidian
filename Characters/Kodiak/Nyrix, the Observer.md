**A Watcher From Beyond Known Space**

Long before humanity planted a foothold in Colonia, a quiet observer drifted in the deep black, farther than even the oldest colonization and exploration ships had yet dared to travel. They belonged to a species whose existence continues to remain unknown to every major power: an elusive people who study emerging civilizations from afar, typically without direct interference.

Humanity had simply become their latest curiosity. For many decades, these mysterious people shadowed the fringes of the galaxy, studying transmissions, analyzing the wars between super powers, and analyzing the cycle of how humans adapt, destroy, rebuild, and expand. Their mandate was simple: observe. But mandate soon changed, observation became _fascination_.

As humanity pushed further and further into the galaxy, their species watched with growing interest and burgeoning curiosity. Especially as Thargoid incursions escalated. Humanity was volatile, reckless, brilliant, and unpredictable. Worth watching… worth understanding.

**First Contact: A Silent Transit to Imperial Space**
The Outsider’s first physical encounter with humans came when an Imperial survey wing strayed farther than intended during an expedition mapping distant anomalies and stellar bodies. One of their capital ships, an Interdictor-class vessel, lingered long enough for the Outsider to approach and cling to it's hull. Their species natural biology and evolutionary adaptations to deep space travel allowed them to survive the journey undetected. Completely hidden, a ghost riding on Imperial Alloy. Forming an almost chrysalis like structure about themselves, the Outsider entered a state of almost torpor state. While their body effectively powered down, their mind remained alert and active, studying the way Imperial pilots moved and flew.

When the ship finally re-entered Imperial space, the Outisder made a decision what would define their existence. They revealed themselves, surrendering to Imperial forces. Rather than refuse communication, the alien life form offered knowledge beyond the Empire's wildest dreams. In exchange for this, they requested access to human technological data, studying human weaponry, technology and starships. The Empire accepted, doing so with a cautious cooperation.

Now, the Outsider became a classified asset.

**Imperial Service: The Contract Specialist**

Nyrix, as the Outsider had revealed their name to be, filled a role no human comfortably could. 

They excelled in Xeno-tech recon, delving into abandoned structures, destroyed Thargoid megaships, and scouting biological anomalies. While they discouraged humans from attempting to do so, on several occasions Imperial researchers would attempt to scan Nyrix, becoming ever more frustrated at the way the interloper seemed to simply not exist. 

Within their duties, Nyrix became inordinately talented at recovering artefacts, samples, and data caches deemed too dangerous, or too strange, for ordinary pilots. They seemed to have little issue with spending long periods of time in deep space, completely alone outside of whatever virtual intelligences they had created. 

Despite the curious nature Nyrix seemed to exude, they had little issue with cold-blooded extermination. Their training with human made weaponry was swift and unervingly efficient. When required, they elimated threats with precision and no hesitation, moving from shadow to shadow like a ghost. Among Imperial Black Ops groups, Nyrix became referred to as "The Calm Blade", an asset that could be sent to secure xeno-related tasks with ruthless efficiency. However, sometimes these assets would go "Missing", become "compromised" or be "diverted during transit". These were the items Nyrix deemed humanity at large unready for, and instead diverted, or destroyed, them. 

**Depature: The Outisder Walks Alone** 

For a time, the Empire tolerated Nyrix's quirks, citing the sheer capability of the alien's intelligence. As their fascination with alien life grew, their alignment with Imperial goals weakened. Their actions, becoming increasingly independent, angered many of their prior benefactors. The Empire, unwilling to outright provoke or detain such an unpredicatble asset, allowed Nyrix to 'resign'. Unofficially, of course. Rumors still swirl in black book operations groups that Nyrix continues to support the Imperial cause in their own way, eliminating what they need to and reporting what the please. 

Drifting into Unaligned space, Nyrix's reputation became something of an urban legend. 

A seven foot tall armored wanderer. Calm and polite, yet forceful enough to accomplish their goals.

To some, Nyrix was a savior, the blade of the Empire come to strike down evil where it could be found. 
To others, they were simply an opportunist, a pretender, or a threat. 
And to all, they remain an unknown. 

**Current Status: [[Hyperion Galactic Commerce Company]]**
Eventually, their wanderings brought them to Hyperion, a corporation seemingly unbothered by their origins. The HGCC allowed them something no superpower truly could. Freedom, autonomy, and access to routes, ruins, and relics normally trapped behind red tape and bureaucracy. Though rarely seen in company holdings, Nyrix reliably transmits exploration data of any interesting finds to the company. While their interest remains firmly routed in Exo-Biology, the Outsider does understand humanity needs resources to expand and explore. In Nyrix at the very least, humanity has a quiet ally, working to improve the fledgling species control and standing in the galaxy. 

**Appearance and Physiology**

Nyrix is always seen in full armor, their face obscured by a reflective armored panel. The entire suit resists being scanned, providing only the most basic information when targetted. It appears to be a hybrid of biological and synthetic compounds. 

Known facts *Confirmed information*:
- Height: 7'2" 
- Build: Talll, lithe, predatory in posture (slightly hunched) 
- Voice: Calm, rational, soft spoken, theorized to be created by an automated translator. 
- Scans reveal unknown hybrid materials in the armor. 
- No two scans ever match perfectly, suggesting adaptive or living circuitry. 
- **No human** has ever seen Nyrix's face.

Described as:
'*A scientists with a predator's patience.'* 

**Summary**

Nyrix remains one of the most enigmatic figures operating around human space. Neither threat, nor ally by default. Their actions follow a logic and code that only they truly understand.

**Species Summary**

The Elythari are an enigmatic, ancient species originating from the deep interstellar void far beyond humanity’s reach or influence. Evolved in regions of perpetual darkness and extreme isolation, they developed tall, lithe and almost predatory physiologies supported by adaptive bio-synthetic tissues: part living matter, part engineered construct. This fusion grants them resilience, long lifespans, and a natural resistance to conventional scanning.

For millennia, the Elythari have acted as silent observers of emerging civilizations. Their guiding philosophy, **The Long Watching**, teaches that knowledge must be gathered with patience and minimal interference. Though not openly expansionist, they possess a technological sophistication that blurs the line between biology and machinery, with armor and tools that behave as semi-living extensions of themselves. Including the virtual intelligences they often travel with.

They rarely intervene directly in the affairs of other species. Individuals like Nyrix, known by their peoples as *Pathfinders*, represent rare exceptions: Elythari who venture outward to study promising or volatile societies firsthand. Their motivations are academic, their methods often rational, and their presence both calming and quietly unsettling.
