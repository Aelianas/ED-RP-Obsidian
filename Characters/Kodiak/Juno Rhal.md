#### ==Bio:==
##### Born on Achenar in 3528, Juno Rhal grew up beneath the polished marble and iron discipline of Imperial society. Like many sons of the core worlds, his path was shaped early: service first, questions later. When finally of age, he enlisted in the Imperial Navy, serving as a fighter pilot under Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval during her early campaigns to solidify her control over the Empire.

##### Rhal’s record was exemplary: fast reflexes, tactical precision, and unwavering loyalty. But that loyalty fractured during what was supposed to be a routine raid on a pirate cargo vessel. When the target’s holds were breached, the “contraband” inside turned out not to be weapons but slaves, abandoned and left to die in decompression. Hundreds had been killed during their attack, and more in the subsequent loss of pressure within the ship. The sight of the Empire’s indifference, and his own part in it, changed him. Rhal disobeyed orders, targeting the pirates' attempted escape pod and destroying it as retribution for the lives they had destroyed.

##### He resigned his commission shortly after, officially citing “combat fatigue,” though the few close to him knew the truth: he could no longer serve a throne that called atrocity justice, nor could he forget his own complicity in the murders. For a time, he drifted between systems, flying as a bounty hunter here and there to keep his reflexes sharp and his conscience quiet. Justice was best dispensed from twin-linked beam canons. But the work left him with a hollow, tired feeling.

##### Rhal eventually found purpose again in search and rescue operations, working independently across the frontier. He can often be located answering SOS beacons in low population systems where few likely would hear the calls for aid. Over time, his ship, Hope’s Relic, became both home and tool. A vessel of worn and scarred armor plates, rescue gear, and repurposed mining drones. Utilizing his payout from retiring from the navy, and the none-to-insignificant stash of credits from his time as a bounty hunter, Rhal owns a small deep space station in which his ships are housed. He now funds his work through cooperation with a corporation via asteroid mining, taking rescue and recovery contracts when the credits or the conscience demand it.

##### Though he avoids Imperial space, Rhal still carries the bearing of a soldier. His voice is measured, his movements deliberate and sure. Pride remains in his very bearing and behavior. He rarely speaks of the Empire, but when he does, his disdain and borderline hatred for Arissa Lavigny-Duval is unmistakable. Not born from rebellion, but from perceived betrayal. While he believes in the reforms of Aisling Duval, Rhal has fallen in with more independent powers: powers like Li Yong-Rui.

##### There are rumors that Juno Rhal, now using the name Kodiak Kaarn, is using his personal funds to filter munitions and supplies to anti-Imperial forces in the Imperial Core worlds. Though most believe these to be nothing more than the bored gossiping of deep space traders and haulers, it has lead to one or two less than friendly encounters with Imperial Special Police. Rhal maintains that these are false, but it bears wondering that he has not revisited his homeworld, family, or people since departing many years ago. To most, Kodiak is a friendly, if a bit standoffish pilot. To some he is a mystery, a wandering hermit seeking precious metals and minerals within asteroid belts. To others yet still, he is a mystery, with motives and goals unknown.
