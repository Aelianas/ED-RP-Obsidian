Race: [[Human]]
#### ==Bio:==
###### Aelianas has green eyes, but wears a purple contact in her natural eye. Her hair color is naturally auburn, but she keeps it dyed a vibrant purple. She is white, but with a very minor tan from a vacation with the love of her life that never really went away.

###### Aelianas was rescued during a search-and-rescue mission at 3 months old. She was found in a Sidewinder, owned by a deceased couple that was boarded and raided by pirates. The standing theory is that the pirates didn't feel particularly good about killing an infant, but they were also not against leaving it to starve. However, some evidence from the crime scene suggested that the pirates sent out a distress call after plundering the ship so that the child could be rescued. Fingerprints not matching the ship's commanders were found on the controls of the distress call sequence keys. The pirates were never caught.

###### The rescuing party was a subdivision of a trading company, [[Lucinda Corporation]], sent out on official rescue missions to aid commanders, but also to take materials that could be sold for a profit if the commander has been killed in action. The company was rendered defunct after a series of less-than-legal operations came to light 20-years-later.

###### Being raised by one of the more rule-abiding executives of the company, she learned how markets and trading work from a young age. Her caretaker, [[Llara Jaimes]], passed away when Aelianas was 19. Llara was in the process of bringing her colleagues crimes to light and bringing down the company, but fell extremely ill and passed away. Aelianas continued her work and brought down the company that rescued her. Llara was her rolemodel and she was not going to let plundering of derelict ships get away unnoticed. Aelianas and Llara believed that the goods from those ships belonged to the commanders' families and should be returned.

###### She is unaffected by the death of her biological parents. In her eyes, Llara was the only mother she could have ever asked for and finds herself extremely lucky to have been raised by her.

###### After the fall of the company, Aelianas met her partner, [[Noodle Vagrantia]] and married, then started a couple companies of her own, the [[Companies/SugarNoodle Trading Company]], named after her and her partner's nicknames put together, and [[Purple Cat Paradise (Company)]], a chain of various entertainment services meant to help commanders unwind after a long, stressful day. Her main goal in starting both of these companies is to offer people various job opportunities in areas where work is scarce, allowing people to make an honest living to afford for their families.

###### Aelianas is extremely casual, goofy, and contagiously cheerful, despite everything she's gone through. However, she can be serious when the moment requires it.

###### Although she was raised to be more law-abiding in some areas, Llara taught her that some situations call for more unlawful responses, such as when security ships allow known criminals to get away with serious crimes. When something like this happens, Aelianas tends to get chaotic and go overboard with her vengance, usually with an ungodly, maniacal cackle.

###### Aelianas is currently the Executive Officer of the [[Hyperion Galactic Commerce Company]]. She is also the Commanding Officer of the [[Purple Cat Paradise (Fleet Carrier)]].
